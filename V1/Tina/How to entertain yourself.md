# How to entertain yourself

When you are bored and do not know what to do next, consider one of the following options.

## Netflix and HBO Max

Netflix and HBO Max are both great series and movie streaming series. Complete the following steps:

1. If you do not have an account yet, create a Netflix or HBO Max account (or both).
2. Log in to your account.
3. Browse series and movies for the following titles:
  - Netflix:
    - Grey's Anatomy **<3**
    - Fuller House
    - New Girl
    - etc.
  
  - HBO Max:
    - Friends
    - Divorce
    - The Big Bang Theory

4. Play the selected title.

## Books

If you do not want to watch stuff, you could also read a book. If you like me do not have a lot of space, I recommend getting a Kindle.<br>
**Note:** I personally prefer actual books due to the smell and because you can actually flip the pages and use bookmarks.

1. Wake up your Kindle
2. Open the Kindle store.
3. Purchase and download one of the following titles:
    - The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (by Mark Haddon)
    - Becoming (by Michelle Obama)
    - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (by J.K. Rowling)
    - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (by J.K. Rowling)
    - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (by J.K. Rowling)

    - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (by J.K. Rowling)
    - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (by J.K. Rowling)
    - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (by J.K. Rowling)
    - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (by J.K. Rowling)
    
4. Start reading.
    

## Nature

Besides watching series and reading books, the nicest option is to go out in nature and enjoy it. Here are several suggestions:

- If you are a runner, go for a run, for example around a lake.
- If you are a hiker - like me, find a nice regional park and bring your dog along, if you have one.<br>
  **Note:** I recommend the AllTrails app to track all hikes that you complete.
- If you prefer to take it slow, grab a picnic blanket and go to a park. <br>You can sunbathe, do yoga, or bring your Kindle! See also [Books](#books).
- Play disc golf.
