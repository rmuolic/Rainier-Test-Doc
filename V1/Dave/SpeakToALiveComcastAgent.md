# Speak to a Live Comcast Agent
Use this procedure when you are frustrated because Comcast support can be so elusive.
1. Google a website for Comcast support.
2. Using a computer or smartphone, follow the online instructions until you realize they have intentionally sent you down an online rabbit hole.
3. Suppress your angry thoughts about monopoly power and breathe deeply.

4. Return to the Internet and look for Comcast support numbers.
5. Using any support number you can find, dial the number and begin interacting with the courteous robot.
6. When possible, push random keys on the keypad in the hope that you will force your way out of the script and default to a live human being.

   Here are some helpful pointers:

   | Do you like French fries?    | Press ^@$!    |
   
7. Keep pushing keys and breathing deeply.
8. Hang up, center your thoughts, and resolve to try again tomorrow.
