uid: Procrastinate

# How to procrastinate for no good reason
1. After finishing the last meeting of the day, realize you actually have an hour or so and can do this today after all. Woohoo!
2. Check email first, just in case.
3. Reply to meeting requests in your inbox.
4. Greet spouse, who just came home with unanticipated take-out dinner from a good restaurant. (Yay!)
5. Eat dinner: lasagna and meatloaf. Comfort food! (See [For more information](#for-more-information).)
6. Unload the dishwasher, then clean up dinner dishes.
7. Do first couple of steps in the homework, then realize you need to think of a procedure to write. Uh-oh! Performance anxiety.
8. Decide you want to make this interesting. Spend a few minutes overthinking it.
9. Conclude that you have no interesting ideas at this point in the day.
10. Ask Dr. Fauci for advice.
11. Write the above as a cautionary tale about checking email before starting a task.
