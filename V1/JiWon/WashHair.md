# How to wash hair

To wash hair, follow this procedure. 
1. Wet hair thoroughly.
- We're in a drought. Don't use too much water.   
- But then again, you need to wet it.   
2. Squeeze shampoo on your hand. Amount varies on the volume of your hair. 
For a quick reference, see [FYI](#fyi) below.
3. Lather shampoo into hair. Don't forget to wash ears also while you have the suds. Earlobe hygiene is important as you get older. Wash behind ear as well.    
**Note:** Do not open eyes. They'll _burn_.
4. Massage scalp vigorously for a minute.
5. Blow your nose.
6. Rinse with water.
7. Dry with a towel.

## Good example
